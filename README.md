## Description

Games is a web application that features two casino games: Roulette and Slots. The application allows users to place bets, spin the roulette wheel or slot machine, and win or lose virtual money based on the game outcomes. The project also includes sound effects and background music, with options to adjust the volume or mute the sound entirely. Comprehensive validation ensures users can only play within their balance limits and that all game inputs are valid.

## Features

- **Roulette**: Place a bet on a number from 0 to 36. Spin the wheel, and if the arrow lands on your number, you win. Otherwise, you lose your bet.
- **Slots**: Place a bet and spin the slot machine. If you get a combination of three identical symbols, you win; otherwise, you lose.
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy sound effects and background music with adjustable volume settings.
- **Validation**: Ensures valid gameplay, such as preventing bets higher than the user's balance and requiring a bet amount and number selection for roulette.
